## Description (4000 chars max)

FoodLogger is a food diary built for people who don't have time for food diaries. Log what you eat in seconds — no calories, no macros, no account required.

LOG BY TEXT, VOICE, OR PHOTO
Type a quick note, speak naturally into your mic, or snap a photo of your meal. After logging by voice or photo, FoodLogger shows you the generated description so you can review and edit it before saving. All three modes are always a tap away from the same sheet.

AUTO MEAL DETECTION
FoodLogger automatically detects whether a meal is breakfast, lunch, dinner, a snack, a dessert, or a beverage — based on what you describe and the time of day. Not happy with the tag? Override it with one tap, right from the entry card or while adding the entry.

INSIGHTS THAT ACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING
The Insights tab gives you eight charts covering your real eating patterns: your most-eaten foods by frequency, daily logging activity, meal category breakdown, meal timing by hour of day, this week vs last week, a monthly consistency heatmap, a food search, and a streak and consistency stats card. Switch between 7-day, 30-day, 3-month, 1-year, and all-time views.

WEEKLY RECAP
Every Sunday evening, FoodLogger sends a notification summarising your week — your top food, streak, consistency, and week-over-week trend. Tap it to open your full weekly recap with category breakdowns and a shareable summary card. The entire recap is generated on-device.

STREAK AND CONSISTENCY TRACKING
FoodLogger counts your consecutive days with at least one logged entry. Your current streak appears in the Today banner every time you open the app, and in the Insights stats card alongside your overall consistency percentage.

CALENDAR AND SEARCH
The Calendar tab shows a full month grid at the top and your entries for any selected day below — tap a date to browse without leaving the screen. The Search button lets you do a full-text search across every entry you have ever logged; tapping a result jumps to that day and highlights the exact entry.

EXPORT YOUR DATA
Export all your entries as a JSON file from Settings and share it anywhere — to another app, a document, or your own records.

PRIVACY — GENUINELY
FoodLogger makes zero network requests. There is no account. There is no server. Nothing you log ever leaves your device. It works completely offline, always.

Everything runs on your device. Always private, always fast, always yours.
